# URI-Solutions

# What's the URI Judge?

The URI Online Judge is a project that is being developed by the Computer Science Department of URI University. The main goal of the project is to provide programming practice and knowledge sharing.

# Are you stuck in some problem?
I'll help you out!! So my idea is to share my solutions for some problems that I have done in order to help some people to understand what they did wrong to get a certain error or how they can solve the problem so they can learn how to code and implove their programming logic.
